- Prefer programming _into_ the language over _in_ the language (Section 4.4 - p.68-69)
- Five level of design
	1) Software System
    2) Division into Subsystems or Packages
    3) Division into Classes
    4) Division into Routines
    5) Internal Routine Design
- Good abstractions make reasoning about the system easier.
- Consider what needs to be hidden when designing at all level.
- Using heuristic for design (p.108)
